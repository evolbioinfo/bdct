# TODO

1. Sign test + binomial law
2. PN test: swap branches of closest cherries
2. Plotter of branch diff vs time
3. PN test for a certain time interval
4. Mixture models to infer the % of notified cherries
5. Add lh diff test BD vs BD-PN: kxi-square test:
   as our parameter hits the border (p_n = 0) we need a mix of kxi with 0 and 1(2?) degrees of freedom (see Anisimova's article on aLTR) -- check that and if too complicated write that we should be more conservative with a simple khi
